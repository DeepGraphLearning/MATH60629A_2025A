# Machine Learning for Large-Scale Data Analysis and Decision Making (MATH80629A): Fall 2021

## Course Description
Welcome to MATH80629A Graduate level course on introduction to machine learning at HEC Montreal (English edition). This is the English edition of the course, for the French edition, please check [here](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~lcharlin/courses/80-629/).
In this course, we will study machine learning models, a type of statistical analysis that focuses on prediction, for analyzing very large datasets ("big data").
The plan is to survey different machine learning techniques (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning) as well as some applications (e.g., recommender systems). We will also study large-scale machine learning and will discuss distributed computational frameworks (Hadoop and Spark).


## Course Format
Due to the online nature of the semester, this course will be given as a [flipped classroom](). It is an instructional strategy where students learn the material before they come to class. The material will be a mix of readings and video capsules. Class time is reserved for more active activities such as problem solving, demonstrations, and questions-answering. In addition, class time will contain a short summary of the week's material.

## Time
Mondays 8:30 - 11:30

## Prerequisites
Basic knowledge of statistics, and Python programming as well as mathematical maturity will be assumed.

## Grading
Your final score for the course will be computed using the following weights:
