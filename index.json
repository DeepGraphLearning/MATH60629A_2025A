Despite their success in encoding large problems with a compact set of weighted rules, performing inference over these models is often challenging. In this paper, we show how to effectively combine two powerful ideas for scaling inference for large graphical models. The first idea, lifted inference, is a wellstudied approach to speeding up inference in graphical models by exploiting symmetries in the underlying problem. The second idea is to frame Maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference as a convex optimization problem and use alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve the problem in parallel. A well-studied relaxation to the combinatorial optimization problem defined for logical Markov random fields gives rise to a hinge-loss Markov random field (HLMRF) for which MAP inference is a convex optimization problem. We show how the formalism introduced for coloring weighted bipartite graphs using a color refinement algorithm can be integrated with the ADMM optimization technique to take advantage of the sparse dependency structures of HL-MRFs. Our proposed approach, lifted hinge-loss Markov random fields (LHL-MRFs), preserves the structure of the original problem after lifting and solves lifted inference as distributed convex optimization with ADMM. In our empirical evaluation on real-world problems, we observe up to a three times speed up in inference over HL-MRFs.","tags":null,"title":"Lifted Hinge-Loss Markov Random Fields","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sabina Tomkins","**Golnoosh Farnadi**","Brian Amanatullah","Steve Minton","Lise Getoor"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1533081600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533081600,"objectID":"454207568abb9e6056a702acd1197ba9","permalink":"/publication/icdm18/","publishdate":"2018-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/icdm18/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"The Impact of Environmental Stressors on Human Trafficking","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Golnoosh Farnadi**","Jie Tang","Martine De Cock","Marie-Francine Moens"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1533081600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533081600,"objectID":"1717196a62a092e82221219459f8a081","permalink":"/publication/wsdm18/","publishdate":"2018-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wsdm18/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"User Profiling through Deep Multimodal Fusion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Golnoosh Farnadi**","Behrouz Babaki","Lise Getoor"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1517529600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1517529600,"objectID":"d8401a4947184b9891ec4be800e7fcfb","permalink":"/publication/aies18/","publishdate":"2018-02-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/aies18/","section":"publication","summary":"In recent years, it has been realized that many problems in data mining can be seen as pure optimisation problems. In this work, we investigate the problem of constraint-based clustering from an optimisation point of view. The use of constraints in clustering is a recent development and allows to encode prior beliefs about desirable clusters. This paper proposes a new solution for minimum-sum-of-squares clustering under constraints, where the constraints considered are must-link constraints, cannot-link constraints and anti-monotone constraints on individual clusters. Contrary to most earlier approaches, it is exact and provides a fundamental approach for including these constraints. The proposed approach uses column generation in an integer linear programming setting. The key insight is that these constraints can be pushed into a branch-and-bound algorithm used for generating new columns. Experimental results show the feasibility of the approach and the promise of the branch-and-bound algorithm that solves the subproblem directly.","tags":null,"title":"Fairness in Relational Domains","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Golnoosh Farnadi**","Stephen H.
