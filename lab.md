# Machine Learning for Large-Scale Data Analysis and Decision Making (MATH60629A): Winter 2024

## Hands-on Sessions

Most of the lab materials are in Python using Colab. 
If you want to create a machine learning model but you donâ€™t have a machine that can take the workload or you don't want to deal with installing packages and resolving installation issues, Google Colab is a suitable option. Colaboratory is a free Jupyter notebook environment provided by Google where you can use free GPUs and TPUs.

### Getting Started
To start working with Colab you first need to log in to your google account, then go to this [link](https://colab.research.google.com).
If you are a new Colab user, you can check [here](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb?utm_source=scs-index#scrollTo=GJBs_flRovLc) or [Google Colab Tutorial for Data Scientists](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/tutorial-google-colab-for-data-scientists) to learn more.
