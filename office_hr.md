# Machine Learning for Large-Scale Data Analysis and Decision Making (MATH60629A): Winter 2025

### Piazza
We will be using [Piazza](https://piazza.com/) for class discussions. The system is designed so that you can get help quickly and efficiently from your classmates and myself. Rather than emailing your questions, I invite you to post them on Piazza. The TA and I will check your questions regularly and respond to them. You can post private questions to us or post your questions to the class anonymously (in this case your identity will only be visible to me). It is preferable to post your questions publicly so that everyone can see them and contribute to the discussion. 

For a short introductory video to Piazza check [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqGummy1Be4&list=PLEOX0FOixqJ4gJEWOelsBJBQ1mD05ZUKC).

The information you will need to activate your account is posted on ZoneCours in an announcement entitled Piazza.  

### Office Hours 
The TA for this course is Hair Parra. We will have flexible office hours. If you would like to meet with me or the TA to discuss your questions, you only need to send us a private message on Piazza. We will then schedule a meeting at a convenient time. It is preferable to first post your questions on Piazza, and then arrange a meeting if necessary.
