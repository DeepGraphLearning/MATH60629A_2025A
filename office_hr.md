# Machine Learning for Large-Scale Data Analysis and Decision Making (MATH60629A): Autumn 2025

### Discord
We will be using Discord ([https://discord.gg/Jz8pX45g](https://discord.gg/Jz8pX45g)) for class discussions. The system is designed so that you can get help quickly and efficiently from your classmates and myself. Rather than emailing your questions, I invite you to post them on Discord. The TA and I will check your questions regularly and respond to them. You can post private questions to us or post your questions to the class anonymously (in this case your identity will only be visible to me). It is preferable to post your questions publicly so that everyone can see them and contribute to the discussion. 

### Office Hours

Tuesdays 2:00 pm - 3:00 pm
Room: 4.805 CSC Building

The TA for this course is Xinyu Yuan and Zhihao Zhan. We will also have flexible office hours. If you would like to meet with me or the TA to discuss your questions, you only need to send us a private message on Discord. We will then schedule a meeting at a convenient time. It is preferable to first post your questions on Discord, and then arrange a meeting if necessary.
